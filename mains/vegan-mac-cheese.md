# Vegan Pumpkin Mac and Cheese


## Ingredients

- 1/2 cup raw cashews
- 2 tablespoons olive oil
- 1/2 small sweet onion chopped
- 3 cloves garlic minced
- 1 cup water
- 15 ounces canned pumpkin puree or fresh cooked pumpkin puree
- 1/4 cup nutritional yeast
- 2 tablespoons lemon juice
- 1/2 teaspoon dried sage
- 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
- 1 teaspoon salt or to taste
- 12 ounces uncooked pasta


## Instructions

1. Heat a few cups of water in a tea kettle or small pot until boiling, then pour over the cashews in a bowl. Let them soak for at least 5 minutes or up to an hour.

2. Warm the olive oil over medium heat in a small sauté pan. Add the onion and sauté for about 5-8 minutes, or until translucent. Add the garlic and cook for 1 more minute, until fragrant. Remove from heat.

3. Drain the cashews and discard the soaking water. Add the cashews to a high-powered blender along with the 1 cup water, onion/garlic, pumpkin puree, nutritional yeast, lemon juice, sage, thyme and salt. Blend until very smooth.

4. Cook the pasta according to package instructions, then drain and return back to the pot you cooked them in. Pour the pumpkin sauce over the pasta, and stir over low-medium heat until it warms throughout. Serve immediately.
